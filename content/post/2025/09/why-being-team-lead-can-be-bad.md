It's commonly believed that a team lead is a higher evolutionary step for an engineer. Even though everyone knows that a team lead requires completely different skills and abilities than a senior engineer. But the fact remains unchanged “most companies promote their best engineer to team lead. Sometimes because it seems the employee will get new motivation, after all, it's a promotion. Sometimes out of necessity“ they hired new employees and someone has to be responsible for them. It's not surprising that an unprepared person, diving into new responsibilities, falls into an existential crisis.

Let's start by defining (though not for the first time on this blog) who this team lead is:

- solves problems
- gets a lot of money
- is a boss
- is a cool specialist

"Being a team lead is cool!“ thinks most developers, especially junior and middle levels, because "I'll be solving very important problems." Finding themselves in the long-awaited role, they will surely experience a bitter feeling that at the standup they have nothing to say about completed features and fixed bugs. It seems like they didn't do anything: attended meetings, answered emails, talked on the phone. And the subordinate's phrase hits straight to the head: "You don't write code at all, you just pretend to conduct code reviews."

There are three classic types of team leads: Wizard, Warrior, Bard.
![Three types of team lead](/images/2025/09/three-types-of-team-lead.webp)

**Wizard**: master of planning, understands business metrics, knows a lot of everything. But their team has no idea what's happening outside the tower where they're conjuring and how their work relates to business tasks. The wizard's team lacks growth and flexibility.

**Warrior**: yesterday's cool senior who can complete more tasks in one day than the entire department in a week. They think all their team members are not very good specialists and don't trust them with complex tasks. As a result, their employees have no hope for growth and development.

**Bard**: always faces the business. Doesn't take responsibility but doesn't know who's responsible for what and generally has a vague understanding of what's happening in the team.

Each of them will satisfy the business in their own way. But they can hardly be called good team leads. And that's because a team lead is an evolutionary branch not of an engineer, but of an employee.

Don't make a bad manager out of a good programmer. (Better do the opposite!)

"But there are no others.“ you'll say, and most businesses too. And here the newly-minted team lead tries to sit on two chairs: engineering and managerial.
![Balancing two chairs](/images/2025/09/balancing-two-chairs.webp)
On one, they think about architecture, close tasks, help the team solve complex problems. On the other, motivate employees, care about their growth. But while running between chairs, something somewhere sags.

And here many will say "Use delegation, what's so difficult about it." Understand that distributing tasks in a task manager is not delegation. Delegation is about transferring responsibility. For example, someone from the team will conduct reviews.

Second useful advice:
**Set up an asynchronous channel for incoming communication**

And get yourself a notebook (well, okay, you can use a notes app). And only after this can you engage in the direct tasks of a team lead: focusing, growing, inspiring, communicating, thinking about people. A tech lead might not work with people (actually, this is, oh, so not true, I recommend my [post](https://nikolaj-sarry.blog/post/2025/07/what-is-engineering-management-looks-like/) on this topic), but a team lead must.

If your people aren't growing you're a bad team lead. And you'll never learn about problems if you don't talk to them. If you can't have a heart-to-heart conversation in a work atmosphere, then offer to give them a ride home (if you have a car and they don't) and get them talking, or suggest going somewhere after work.

It wouldn't hurt to remember the philosophy of Ikigai and embark on the path of searching and never being unhappy on this path.
