Have you ever found yourself sitting at your computer, ready to start working
on a project, and just staring at the screen? I've been there,
and I understand your internal struggle.

In this article, I've compiled 5 strategies that help me in this battle
and allow me to achieve goals, even when I don't feel like it.

Even when you love your work, you don't always want to do it.
There are many factors that affect your ability to come to work with enthusiasm
and work diligently throughout the day.

External events can take priority in your mind—family conflicts,
relationship breakups, a sick pet—these things make it difficult to focus on work.
Additionally, difficulties arise at work that prevent you from feeling motivated.
Negative feedback can derail you, especially if you're working hard on a project
and your manager doesn't appreciate it.
And you start wondering why you're even working at all.

In other cases, you have to work on tasks you don't enjoy (like writing documentation)
or on projects that don't contain any challenging problems.
If you're not interested in the work assigned to you,
or if the task seems insurmountable, finding motivation becomes even harder.

What do we do in such cases? Many people postpone or ignore such tasks,
but that's just delaying the inevitable.
You can try to talk your way out of a task, and perhaps your manager
will support you, but the work still needs to be done.

If you want to consistently perform at a high level and achieve success,
you must learn to show up regardless of circumstances.
This means you need to learn to overcome difficulties and achieve valuable results.

Since these situations happen to me quite often, I'd like to share 5 strategies
that help me get work done, even when I don't feel like it.

## Strategy 1: Gamify the Process

In the early stages of my career, working on large projects used to intimidate
and hold me back. If a project had many tasks I didn't know how to complete
or that seemed truly difficult, internal resistance would flare up
because I was overwhelmed by the scale.

Of course, I would procrastinate until there was minimal time left
to complete the project.
This inevitably led to insanely long working hours, and sometimes
the resulting code "worked," but wasn't production-ready (for example,
several bugs, insufficient edge case coverage, minimal testing,
working only in my environment, etc.).
It was very stressful and usually meant my work wasn't as good as it would have been
if I had started on time.

This was one of my biggest obstacles early in my career—I had trouble getting started.

I discovered that if you simplify the process of starting work,
the first few steps in a complex project become easier and more manageable.
After taking these few steps, continuing forward became much easier.

My solution was to break down the project into as many simple steps as possible
when beginning work. This way, I could get several really easy wins.
For example, some steps were tasks like "Google ____" or "Talk to ____."
Crossing things off a to-do list gives your brain a small dose of dopamine,
even if the tasks are tiny—this maintains motivation.

Try breaking your next project into the smallest possible pieces.
Each step should be very small (ideally, each task should take 15 minutes or less)
and you'll discover how easy the project actually becomes.

You need to overcome inertia. Small wins eventually add up to a big one
and make completing the entire task easier.

## Strategy 2: Block Calendar Time for Each Project

Set aside time in your calendar specifically to work on
the task you're struggling to start.
Treat it as seriously as any other appointment.
You must be prepared to work on this project.

Allocate a realistic amount of time to make progress—at least 30 minutes to 1 hour.
This strategy is key for busy people or managers.
If you don't plan time for meaningful strategic work,
your time will be filled with tactical tasks.
![strategy 2 - calendar and time management](/images/2025/10/calendar-and-time-management.webp)
But what if you don't want to work on the task at the scheduled time?
Set a timer when you start working, say for 10 minutes,
and tell yourself you only need to work until the timer goes off.

Start working through the list of short steps you created for yourself:

- Google something that will help with the project;
- set up your project environment;
- send one email;
- review one document.

Almost always, one or two of these tiny steps will get your brain engaged
and make it easier to continue working. You'll complete one task,
cross it off the list, and then complete another.
Your 10-minute timer will go off, but you'll simply continue working
because now you're engaged with the project.

If you're really not engaged after 10 minutes (though this will happen rarely),
allow yourself to take a break.
But schedule another time block on your calendar to return to the project soon.

## Strategy 3: Involve Other People

Sometimes the best way to make yourself do something
is to make yourself accountable to another person.

According to research by the American Society of Training and Development,
people who are accountable to someone else have a 65% chance of achieving their goal.
The percentage increases to 95% if a specific meeting with that person is scheduled.

Our brains are wired not to let other people down.
If someone invests in you by agreeing to help you achieve your goal,
you motivate yourself to contribute from a desire to fulfill that commitment.
![strategy 3 - involve other people](/images/2025/10/team-collaboration.webp)
You can do this in several ways:

- **Set deadlines with your manager** for completing specific aspects
of the project and schedule regular status check-ins.
- **Ask for help** on part of the project. With another person's help,
you'll reduce your workload and be able to work on other parts of the project.
Schedule time to meet with your helper to combine results.
- **Schedule recurring meetings with colleagues** for collaborative work.
For example, if you're assigned to conduct a series of tedious tests
you'd prefer to postpone,
schedule time to sit down and complete them together.
- **Try using the daily standup meetings** aspect of Scrum with your teammates.

Delegating work can be especially helpful when facing a truly large project.
Sometimes the scope is so enormous that it's difficult to begin.
If you can ask your team for help completing part of the project,
you can focus your efforts on a more manageable workload.

## Strategy 4: Talk About It

Bringing problems into discussion can significantly ease their resolution.
As a rule, problems are often inflated in our minds,
especially when we're worried about them.

I can't say exactly how many times I've discussed my concerns
about a project—for example,
that I have no ideas or that it's very difficult and I can't imagine
how it will be solved.
But each time, by the end of such conversations,
I felt inspired and empowered to do everything we discussed.
In other cases, I worry that something might go wrong, which is very overwhelming.

According to scientific research, talking about feelings out loud reduces stress
and negative emotions we experience.
Brain visualization conducted at UCLA showed that when a person sees
an image of an angry face,
the amygdala becomes more active. This part of the brain is responsible for activating
the "alarm system" of the body, which signals there's
something to fear and makes you act and cope with the problem.

However, when study participants could name what they saw,
the simple fact of expressing the observed feeling in words caused
a decrease in amygdala activity.
Moreover, the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex then activated,
which research shows is responsible for processing emotions
and expressing emotional experiences in words.

Thus, simply talking about your big project can help you start working on it.

Additionally, if you talk to smart friends or mentors,
they may have suggestions about how to get started or share experiences
of how they did something similar themselves.
You'll become both smarter and more relaxed at the same time.

## Strategy 5: Practice the Art of "Productive Procrastination"

Have you ever had trouble working from home because you were distracted
by unwashed dishes or trash that needed to be taken out?
You were probably told you were procrastinating, but actually, it's quite the opposite.

I'm a master procrastinator. I can find any excuse not to start work
or even think about starting. As we all know, procrastination is bad.
It stems from fear of starting work, so you actively hold yourself back
from making progress by doing things that distract
you from what you actually need to do.

But there's something useful about procrastination.
When you're working on a project, your brain needs breaks.
Not just to recharge, but also to establish new connections and create new ideas.
Therefore, getting up to wash dishes, take out the trash, fold laundry,
take a shower, go for a walk, or any other activity that allows distraction
can actually be beneficial for your overall productivity.

When you do something that brings you satisfaction,
your brain releases dopamine (this also happens
when you cross an item off your to-do list).
So when you take a walk in the middle of the workday, your brain gets a dose of dopamine.

Dopamine activates parts of the brain associated with creativity and makes them work.
This is when bright ideas manifest, as your brain sends energy to areas
that help establish new connections and allow you to look at things in a new way.
![strategy 5 - take productivity break](/images/2025/10/productive-break.webp)
So the next time you're stuck on a project you don't want to start,
try distracting yourself and doing something that can bring you satisfaction.
A bright idea might come to you while you're washing dishes,
and you'll run to your computer to get started on the work.
