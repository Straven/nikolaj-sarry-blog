2012, [Jessica McKellar](https://twitter.com/jessicamckellar) and her MIT friends launched the stealth chat startup Zulip. Nearly two years later, [Dropbox acquired it](https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/17/dropbox-acquires-zulip-a-stealthy-workplace-chat-solution-still-in-private-beta/). It had happened before when [Ksplice was quickly sold to Oracle](http://www.ksplice.com/). This rapid trajectory gave McKellar more diverse management opportunities than the average engineer gets in an entire career. She's been a team lead, founder, technical leader at a massive corporation, and today manages dozens of employees at a fast-growing international startup. (She's also a [significant figure in the Python world](http://pyvideo.org/speaker/jessica-mckellar.html)).

## Three Pillars of Engineering Management

![Three Pillars of Engineering Management](/images/2025/07/three-pillars-framework.webp)
When engineering management is done correctly, you focus on three important things:

1. **Direct Team Support**: You directly support your team members
2. **Execution Management**: You manage execution and coordinate interactions between teams
3. **Organizational Development**: You step back to observe and develop the organization and its processes as it grows
   This sounds simple, McKellar says, but each of these areas has deep complexities and challenges.

## Direct Team Support

### The Daily and Yearly Perspective

> "When you're a technical leader, your job happens primarily with people. There are two things you should always think about: people's daily and yearly lives."

You should imagine that each person is walking these two paths simultaneously. As a leader, you can shape their experience on each path, helping them find a trajectory that aligns with their goals and your needs.

### Daily Management

**Daily life focus**: You want everyone to be happy, productive, and engaged in their work.

This includes:

- Regular one-on-one meetings
- Setting aside time and space to discuss small problems or obstacles
- Laying out projects on boards to break them into pieces
- Walking through complex interpersonal situations
- Taking breaks when someone is having a tough day

**Key principle**: Find balance between structured weekly routines and unallocated time for real-time feedback.

### Long-term Career Development

The more complex task is helping people develop a long-term plan for ensuring happy productivity at your company.

#### Understanding Employee Goals

To build long-term relationships with an engineer, you need to learn enough about them to create a foundation for jointly thinking about career growth. You need employees to articulate:

- **Skills they want to improve**
- **Technical and non-technical experience they want to gain**
- **How they want to increase their impact on the company**

#### Quarterly Career Growth Process

> "Once a quarter I say, 'Okay, next week is dedicated to career growth' and that's exactly what we'll talk about during individual meetings."

#### Creating Psychological Safety

**Breaking down big questions**: Instead of asking "What do you want to do in five years?" (which creates pressure), frame it as: "Are we doing everything right so you get the experience you want to pursue what you want in the future?"
**Leader vulnerability**: Share your own career plans first to model honesty and openness.

### Career Path Framework

![Carrer Path Framework](/images/2025/07/career-dual-path-track.webp)

#### Dual Track System

This can be done by creating two clear, fully parallel paths:

1. **Technical Specialist Track**: For those who want to solve increasingly complex technical problems
2. **Management Track**: For those interested in coordination, mentoring, and culture building

> **Important**: "It's unfortunate when companies force people into management as the only career growth option. This is a clear mistake."

#### Identifying the Right Path

**Key question**: What changes do they want to make in the company? What problems do they specifically want to solve?
**Technical Track Indicators**:

- Enjoy developing solutions to complex technical problems
- Interested in high technical risks and innovative solutions
- Want to go deep on technical expertise

**Management Track Indicators**:

- Like the human side of the equation
- Enjoy coordinating efforts between groups
- Want to mentor others and create community culture
- Interested in recruiting, personal interaction, cross-team collaboration

#### Recognition Beyond Job Descriptions

> "Many companies don't have indicators or frameworks for recognizing these small things that go beyond the job description. It's very important that any existing career growth resources account for these things."

## Team Capabilities and Management Ability

### The Transition from Individual Contributor

> "There's a turning point when someone transitions from engineer to manager, and it can be very uncomfortableâ€”you feel like you're just going to meetings and not doing anything else."

**The trade-off**: Stepping away from writing code gives you time to:

- Gather broader organizational context
- Make strategically important organizational investments
- Notice and fix inefficiencies with global perspective

### The Multiplier Effect

> "Always remember this truth: If you can help people on your team develop their individual capabilities, you can do more, and in geometric progression."

### Delegation and Trust

#### Empowering Technical Decision-Making

> "You need to develop experts in teams, projects, and platforms who can think deeply and lead structural discussions."

**Key principle**: Give technical specialists the opportunity to make decisions independently without using you as a crutch for decision-making every time.

#### Creating a Learning Environment

**Failure tolerance**: Accept that people can make mistakes and learn from them. Create an environment where people feel comfortable even after failure.
**Post-mortem process**: Conduct instructive, action-requiring analyses of failures:

- Give teams time and space to reflect on why projects ended a certain way
- Focus on what can be done differently next time
- Identify organizational or procedural changes needed
- Facilitate discussion and summarize for other teams

#### Balancing Experience Levels

**Knowledge exchange**: Maintain balance between experienced and less experienced engineers working together.
**Two-way learning**:

- **New engineers**: Bring fresh perspective, question established practices
- **Experienced engineers**: Bring good habits and discipline to complex projects

**Project distribution**: Evenly distribute challenging projects between both categories.

> "You want to constantly raise the level of everyone on your team. Mastery will catch up."

## Tools and Processes for Acceleration

### Environment Setup

As a manager, you must ensure a productive development environment:

- **Right tools**: Acquire appropriate development tools
- **Feature/maintenance balance**: Balance new feature work with improving existing projects
- **Smooth onboarding**: Help new engineers orient, understand success metrics, and performance measurement

#### Onboarding as a Leadership Tool

> "Onboarding new employees is one of the most powerful tools at your disposal as a leader."

Benefits:

- Helps new engineers understand their role and claim ownership
- Gives existing employees opportunities to mentor and share knowledge
- Identifies future managers and growth trajectories

### Meeting and Review Processes

#### Architecture Reviews

> "We emphasize an architecture review process that ensures the right stakeholders are in the room and everyone gets feedback from the right people."

**Checkpoints**: Before implementing ambitious long-term projects, conduct several checkpoints to review plans, answer questions, and check feasibility.

#### Multi-level Feedback Systems

> "You need systems that simultaneously catch missing commas and make people think more broadly about what good architecture looks like."

- **Code reviews**: Technical feedback at detailed level
- **Planning discussions and architecture reviews**: Higher-level feedback

#### Adaptive Management Style

> "As people level up, their needs gradually change."

- **New engineers**: Need active communication to identify where they're stuck
- **Experienced engineers**: Usually know how to raise issues themselves

### Communication and Transparency

#### Eliminating Inefficiencies

**Common problem**: Long email exchanges about technical problems without resolution. **Solution**: Put all participants in one room for 10 minutes.

#### Default to Over-communication

> "Generally speaking, engineers aren't told enough information, so my mentality is to reveal information I have at meetings, checks, reviews, whenever I can. We over-communicate by default."

**Balance**: Fine line between protective leadership and denying engineers access to important company context.

### Motivation as a Tool

#### Project-based Motivation

> "People are always enthusiastic about the next important thing. The hardest part is finishing the last 5% of a project you've been working on for a long time."

**Solution**: Help engineers see their work through the lens of company impact, especially for those who value visibility and growth.

#### Recognition and Fundamental Work

**Two-part success formula**:

1. **50%**: Having a team that cares about fundamental work required for greatness
2. **50%**: Recognition - ensuring fundamental work gets acknowledged

> "An attentive technical manager notices all the hard work, especially if it's not too visible."

#### Company Values as Motivation

**Operational values**: Monitor company-wide values and principles that have operational potential. Engineers often cite these as reasons for joining the company.
**Quality focus example**: At Dropbox, competitive advantage comes from simplicity and "just works" philosophy, making the last 5% of polish naturally motivating.
