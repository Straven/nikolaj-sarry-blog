My name is Mykola Sarry and I am an IT Project Manager. Here I'm sharing my thoughts and experience.

For more than 6 years I've been managing IT projects, which includes selecting a team and choosing the right methodology.

I mostly work with eCommerce, automated systems, document management systems, CRM, task management systems, and web applications.

Since 2021 HL.Today started from time to time post some of my work. In their rating I manage to get some top places:

- 3rd in January 2022
- 2nd in May 2022
- 2nd in June 2022
- 3rd in November 2022

It is nice to meet you here, so grab your favourite cup of tea, coffee or another drink of your choice and relax.
